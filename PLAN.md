@workspace This project contains an ASP.net Core MVC application which runs in a devcontainer #file:devcontainer.json . The project needs to be converted from ASP.net Core MVC to Spring Boot. Generate a step-by-step plan for performing the code conversion.

Requirements:

- We will be using Visual Studio Code and Dev Containers
- The Spring Boot codebase should mirror the ASP.net codebase as closely as possible
- The Spring Boot codebase should use Java naming conventions
- The ASP.net tests should also be migrated

Be sure to address the following topics:

- Should the conversion be performed in a C# or Java Dev Container?
- How do you initialize a Spring Boot project?
- Where should the Spring Boot code be located while performing the conversion?
- We will use Copilot to perform the C# to Java conversion. Can the process be automated?
- What order should the files be converted?

### Step-by-Step Plan for ASP.net Core MVC to Spring Boot Conversion

1. **Dev Container Selection**:

   - The conversion should be performed in a Java Dev Container. This is because the target framework is Spring Boot, which uses Java. This environment will provide better support for Java-specific tools and libraries needed during the conversion.

2. **Initialize a Spring Boot Project**:

   - Use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a basic Spring Boot project structure. Choose Maven or Gradle as the build tool, Java as the language, and specify the necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA).
   - Alternatively, in the Java Dev Container, use the Spring Boot CLI to initialize the project with `spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa --build=maven my-spring-boot-project`.

3. **Spring Boot Code Location**:

   - Create a new directory within the workspace for the Spring Boot codebase, separate from the ASP.net codebase. This will help in organizing and comparing the two codebases side by side. For example, create a directory named `spring-boot-version` at the root level of the workspace.

4. **Automation with Copilot**:

   - While Copilot can significantly aid in the C# to Java conversion by suggesting code snippets and patterns, the process cannot be fully automated. Manual review and adjustments will be necessary to ensure that the Java code adheres to Spring Boot conventions and the application's specific requirements.

5. **Conversion Order**:

   - **Models**: Start with converting the models/entities. This will establish the basic data structures used throughout the application.
   - **Repositories**: Next, convert the data access layer, adapting C# repositories to Spring Data JPA repositories.
   - **Services**: Convert the business logic layer, ensuring that services in Spring Boot use the converted repositories and operate as expected.
   - **Controllers**: Convert the controllers, adjusting routing, request handling, and response generation to Spring MVC patterns.
   - **Configuration and Utilities**: Convert any configuration files and utility classes, adapting them to Spring Boot's configuration mechanisms.
   - **Views**: If applicable, convert views. ASP.net MVC views will need to be rewritten for use with a compatible template engine in Spring Boot, such as Thymeleaf.
   - **Tests**: Finally, convert the tests, starting with unit tests for models and repositories, followed by service tests, and ending with integration tests for controllers.

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Throughout the conversion, pay close attention to Java naming conventions and Spring Boot best practices.
   - Regularly test the Spring Boot application to ensure that each converted part functions as expected.
   - Consider using Spring Boot's extensive support for configuration and customization to enhance the application beyond the capabilities of the original ASP.net Core MVC application.
